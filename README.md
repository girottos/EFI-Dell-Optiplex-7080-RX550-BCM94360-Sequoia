# EFI-Dell-Optiplex-7080-RX550-BCM94360-Sequoia
EFI to use with Dell Optiplex 7080 Small Form Factor with its internal GPU HD630 + a discrete Radeon RX500LP 4Gb MaxSun 1x HDMI 1x DP Current opencore 1.0.1.
My Unit has 2x DP HDMI Onboard, all working with Intel UHD Graphics 630. BIOS settings like all the others you see around GITHUB and Dortania Guides. SMBIOS for iMac20,1 - You can change S/N and type if you have i9 for instance set it to iMac20,2.
Not using Intel original Wifi car, swapped by native BCM94360NG.
Radeon RX 550 LP 4Gb, MaxSun brand from Ali, Native, just added device-is FF67 and it worked out of the both including HDMI Audio. Onboard Audio with layout 67.
